# SystemViewControllers
Exercise : System view controllers(Develop in Swift Data Collections)


Got familiar with view controllers which extend the functionality of the apps. 
For example, you might want to access a user's photo library, share data to other apps, or respond to certain user choices.

Learnt the following:
- How to use UIActivityViewController to share content to other installed apps
- How to use SFSafariViewController to present information from the internet without exiting the app
- How to use UIAlertController to present new information and options, as well as how to respond to the user's actions
- How to use UIImagePickerController to access the device's camera and photo library and allow the user to select an image
- How to use MFMailComposeViewController to send emails from within the app

Created a project that uses these system view controllers and combines them to provide a better, more familiar user experience.
